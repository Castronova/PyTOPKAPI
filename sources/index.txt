PyTOPKAPI is a `BSD licensed
<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html>`_ Python library
implementing the TOPKAPI Hydrological model (Liu and Todini, 2002).
The model is a physically-based and fully distributed hydrological
model, which has already been successfully applied in several
countries around the world (Liu and Todini, 2002; Bartholomes and
Todini, 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Martina et al., 2006; Vischel et al.,
2008).

The main strengths of the TOPKAPI model are:

* The physical basis of the equations,
* the fine-scale representation of the spatial catchment features,
* the parsimonious parametrisation linked to field/catchment information,
* the good computation time performance,
* the modularity of the processes,
* the ease of use.

These and the good results obtained in modelling the river discharges
of Liebenbergsvlei catchment, make the TOPKAPI model a promising tool
for hydrological modelling of catchments in South Africa and around
the world.

.. note::

   PyTOPKAPI is under active development and the public interface
   (API) is not yet considered stable. However, the model is already
   usable and we would welcome feedback from users and collaborators
   as we work to stabilize the API and make the model more robust and
   useful.
