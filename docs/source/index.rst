PyTOPKAPI is a Python library implementing the TOPKAPI Hydrological
model (Liu and Todini, 2002).  The model is a physically-based and
fully distributed hydrological model, which has already been
successfully applied in several countries around the world (Liu and
Todini, 2002; Bartholomes and Todini, 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Martina
et al., 2006; Vischel et al., 2008).

The physical basis of the equations, the fine-scale representation of
the spatial catchment features, the parsimonious parameterisation
linked to field/catchment information, the good computation time
performance, the modularity of the processes, the ease of use and
finally the good results obtained in modelling the river discharges of
Liebenbergsvlei catchment, make the TOPKAPI model a promising tool for
hydrological modelling of catchments in South Africa and around the
world.
