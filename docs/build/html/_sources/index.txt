The TOPKAPI hydrological modelling system
=========================================

Overview
--------

TOPKAPI is a Python library implementing the TOPKAPI distributed Hydrological
model (Liu and Todini, 2002).  The model is a physically-based and fully 
distributed hydrological model, which has already been successfully applied in
several countries in the world (Liu and Todini, 2002; Bartholomes and Todini, 
2005; Liu et al., 2005; Martina et al., 2006; Vischel et al., 2008).

The physical basis of the equations, the fine-scale representation of the 
spatial catchment features, the parsimonious parameterisation linked to 
field/catchment information, the good computation time performance, the 
modularity of the processes, the ease of use and finally the good results 
obtained in modelling the river discharges of Liebenbergsvlei catchment, make 
the TOPKAPI model a promising tool for hydrological modelling of catchments in
South Africa and around the world.
